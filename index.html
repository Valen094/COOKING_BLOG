                prepared with hand-minced lamb, for which a fatty meat is usually chosen that adheres properly to the
                swords or skewers and for this it is common to use lamb tail. Enjoy this delicious Middle Eastern dish,

                    <li>1 teaspoon chili flake</li>
                    <li>2 garlic cloves, shelled</li>

                    <li>1 cup red bell pepper, finely chopped, drain as much as possible to remove excess water</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ordered_list">
                <h2>Preparation</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Crush the coriander seed, cumin and chile flakes in a molcajete or mortar until you get a
                        powder.
                        Add the garlic and crush to form a reddish paste. Booking.</li>

                    <li>Combine ground lamb with drained red bell pepper, paprika, garlic paste, and enough salt and
                        pepper
                        in a bowl; integrates perfectly. Remember that due to the amount of fat that the meat has, it
                        will
                        be very manageable. In many parts of Turkey they let this preparation rest for a whole night,
                        you
                        can do it if you wish.</li>

                    <li>Take 3 long wooden skewers and stick a little of the meat mixture with your hands to each one,
                        you will notice how easy it will be to manipulate. Press to adhere the meat and give it an
                        elongated shape. Repeat until you finish the meat.</li>

                    <li>Cook the kebabs on a hot charcoal grill for 10 minutes, turning regularly. Also, remember that
                        the
                        characteristic of this dish is that on the outside it usually looks like dried meat, but on the
                        inside it must be very juicy meat. Once ready, remove the kebabs from the charcoal.</li>

                    <li>Serve the kebabs with roasted tomato, red onion and roasted green chiles. Remember to include
                        pita bread and yogurt sauce to accompany.</li>
